I have used BDD framework here 
I have used maven to build the framework (Usually basic selenium webdriver user is unable to share programe/code to another user due to multiple versions of jar file). This is a big advantage of using framework rather than just the basic selenium.  
I used Cucumber as a platfrom to write down the testcases using gherkins language. 
I used selenium, Java and Browserstack together to test:                                                                                                                              - iphone 11 & os version 14 & chrome                                                                                                                                                      - iphone XS & os version 13 & chrome                                                                                                                                                - Mac Mojave & os version X & Safari & browser version 12.1                                                                                                                        - Samsung Galaxy s20 & Os version 10 & chrome                                                                                                                                      - Windows 10 & Firefox_81                                                                                                                                                        Which is more advanced than selenium grid in terms of cost ,time & hassle.
